    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I found a few footnotes and deleted them manually.
    There might be more. They didn’t have a pattern. 2- Page 434 onwards (after the
    last first-level header) is a different text; a Musnad by Imam Musa. It should
    be separated.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
